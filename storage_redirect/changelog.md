# Changelog

## 4.2.2 (2020-03-22)

- Fix the problem that, in the app settings, online rule loads before accessible folder causing bad experience under bad network

## 4.2.1 (2020-03-21)

- Change the implementation of "New app notification" and notifications of "Export isolated files" rules. The can workaround 💩 MIUI's system bug<sup>**〔1〕**</sup> and a minor historical issue<sup>**〔2〕**</sup>

- Add more foolproof design

<sub>**〔1〕** In uncertain situations, MIUI will deserialize (`unparcel`) the `Bundle` in the `Intent` passed by `startActivity` in `system_server`. If the `Bundle` contains a non-system `Parcelable`, deserialization fails and the `Bundle` is broken forever, the app will only receive a blank `Bundle`.</sub>
<br><sub>**〔2〕** If the data structure changes and the core service has not been updated after installing a new version of the app, the app will crash when showing notification.</sub>

- Core services continue to function after an "abnormal restart"
