### As Easy as you are a system app

```java
private static final IPackageManager PACKAGE_MANAGER = IPackageManager.Stub.asInterface(
    new ShizukuBinderWrapper(SystemServiceHelper.getSystemService("package")));

public static void grantRuntimePermission(String packageName, String permissionName, int userId) {
    try {
        PACKAGE_MANAGER.grantRuntimePermission(packageName, permissionName, userId);
    } catch (RemoteException tr) {
        throw new RuntimeException(tr.getMessage(), tr);
    }
}
```

::: tip

There a few more steps to do, like checking permission or if Shizuku is running.
