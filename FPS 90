### Start with root

For rooted devices, just start directly.

### Start via wireless debugging

Starting with wireless debugging works on Android 11 or above. This startup method does not require a connection to a computer. Due to system limitations, the startup steps need to be performed again after each reboot.

#### Enable Wireless debugging

1. Search the web for how to enable "Developer options" for your device model
2. Enable "Developer options" and "USB Debugging"<br><br><img :src="$withBase('/images/enable_dev_options.png')" style="max-width:320px;width:100%">
